I am a pilot, air traffic controller, and engineer, and work for EUROCONTROL, Performance Review Unit.
My research interests include data science applied to operational performance analysis of air transportation/air navigation, complex systems, and time-critical decision-making.

Amongst others, I am convinced that open data and open-source software can be a real game changer for our industry and its operational performance. Throughout the recent years I am promoting the development of an open data environment and associated research community. An exciting project my unit is currently working on is related to deploying a (pan-European) performance referenece trajectory in collaboration with crowd-sourced / community driven networks.

The aforementioned approach and project introduced me also to the R/RStudio ecosystem. In this context, I am also attempting to promote the publication of results, papers, and smaller pieces (e.g. blog posts) by providing data, code, and text together adhering to the principles of reproducible research.

Do not hesitate to get in touch with me, if you are interested in one of the topics or information you find on this page
