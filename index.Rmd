Hello World!

This is a revamp of my website ... and work in progress. 

If you see this page, it is likely that my posts are not yet fully migrated.    
I decided to move from a half-cooked `hugo/blogdown`-driven page to `distill`. Primarily for its simplicity and a lower maintenance requirements.

As usual, for further questions/discussions I assume you somehow know how to contact me.     
Stay safe,     
RQ
